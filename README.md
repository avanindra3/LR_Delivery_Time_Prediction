# Linear Regression Based Delivery Time Prediction
The growing demand for quick and efficient delivery in the logistics industry calls for the developmentof systems that can predict delivery times accurately. Porter, an intra-city logistics marketplace,services millions of customers daily, and optimising delivery times is crucial for improving operationalefficiency.

The objective is to build a linear regression model that can perform the following:
1. Predict the delivery time for an order based on various input features.
2. Help optimise delivery operations by providing accurate time estimates.
3. Support operational planning and resource management, allowing for more effective use ofdelivery partners
